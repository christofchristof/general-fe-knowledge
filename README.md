# Advanced Javascript (from my point of view)

In this markdown I am going to be throwing interesting information about Javascript that I have experienced / read.

70% of a developer's time is spent reading code!  
I would suggest understanding better the language and its core functionalities would help us improve our code and spend less time reading and more time writing.

So, first of all something **very important** is that the web console, node etc. are JavaScript-like. They are not behaving as the core Javascript spec expects. The only way to do that is to write Javascript on an empty file and run it on the browser!

Second of all always have the [Official Javascript Specs](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/Ecma-262.pdf) opened on a tab and visit it every time you have a doubt about something.

You can follow the order in which I wrote them or just jump to the subject that interests you the most:

1.  [Primitive Types](primitive-types.md)
2.  [Natives](natives.md)
3.  [Abstract Operations](abstract-operations.md)
4.  [Explicit Coercion](explicit-coercion.md)
5.  [Implicit Coercion](implicit-coercion.md)
6.  [Javascript is a Compiled Language](javascript-is-a-compiled-language.md)
7.  [Anonymous and Named Function Expressions](function-expressions.md)
8.  [Scope](scope.md)
9.  [Hoisting](hoisting.md)
10. [Closure](closure.md)
11. [Modules](modules.md)
12. [`new` keyword](new.md)
13. [This](this.md)
14. [FE generic questions](questions/README.md)
