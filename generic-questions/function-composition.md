# What is Function Composition?

"**Function Composition**" is applying one **function** to the results of another: The result of f() is sent through g() It is written: (g ยบ f)(x).

Function composition is the process of combining two or more functions to produce a new function. Composing functions together is like snapping together a series of pipes for our data to flow through.
