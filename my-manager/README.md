# My Manager README

Hi, I'm Stephane, as your manager, I look forward to getting to know you more through conversations and interactions. To give you a head start in knowing me I'd like to share my management style, philosophy, expectations and some information about myself.

This is a living document, which will change. Please let me know if you have any feedback on how to make this more useful to you and the team.

## My Job

My role is to:

- provide context
- be accountable for the engineering team's decisions, progress and general success
- engage, retain, and grow world-class talent (that's you!)

I am **not** here to make all the decisions nor should I or should you let me.

**I'm here to help, empower and support you, to set context for what you're working on, and to advocate for you and the team with the rest of the company.**

Everyday I work to guide, advise and facilitate the growth of our team and our impact on the products we build and support.

## Leadership Style

I'm a believer in [Servant Leadership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_leadership). I serve you, not the other way around. I'm always available to assist. Ask me.

You work for the company, not for me. Optimize for the company. I'm making mistakes, and I want to improve just like you. Hold me accountable. Tell me.

## Your Role

A team's success is not defined by any one person's achievements or failures.

> Each and every member of our team needs to help positively influence, guide, change, and improve our product, technology & processes.

That is your role and the role of everyone on the team. At times you will need to be able to change the mindsets and beliefs of your team; this give and take, these professional debates, are not optional. They **will** make you a better professional and leader, but they can be trying and often difficult. I'm here to provide guidance and course correct the conversation if need be, but I cannot and will not speak for you.

## 1-1 Meetings

- 1-1s are very important to me because they are dedicated space for you to talk about anything and everything you want
- They are meetings primarily for you, and only secondarily for me
- It’s not a status meeting, unless you want to talk about status
- 1-1s are flexible -- they can shift and change to fit around our shifting schedules
- Don’t save urgent matters for a 1-1!

Few ideas that can be discussed in these meetings:

- new ideas you have that you need a sounding board for
- if there is something I can do to guide you, coach you
- if you're having a problem and you don't know how to attack it
- if you want to discuss something and need someone to listen

## How I Manage

### I trust my team

I trust each and every member of our team. Trust isn't earned, it's lost.

### I like to be challenged

I hire smart people because I like to surround myself with opinionated, passionate, hard-working people. Please challenge my ideas, thoughts and feedback. If you're not comfortable doing it in a group setting please make sure to voice your thoughts in our 1-1.

### I embrace a work/life balance

I typically work between 9am and 6pm, and unless there's an emergency, I don't expect to communicate with you (about work) outside of these hours. As such, I **never** expect you to respond to me outside these hours either unless it is an emergency.

### I want you to be and feel productive

Regardless of where you work, our success relies on your independence and autonomy. My role is to provide a framework and support so you can be productive and _feel_ productive. If our processes or procedures don't enable you to be productive or feel productive make sure to tell me.

### I want our team to add value

I love talking technology and can do so for hours on end; but technology is rarely the only component an engineering team produces or supports. I expect the team to focus on adding business value and making decisions that ensure we can and do deliver on our commitments to the business and our customers.

### I want you to grow

I expect the team to have a passion for learning and growing and I will do my best to challenge and entice you to learn new and exciting things.
