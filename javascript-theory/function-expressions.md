## Anonymous and Named Function Expressions

```js
var clickHandler = function() {
  // ...
};

var keykHandler = function keykHandler() {
  // ...
};
```

The first function is called **anonymous function expression**  
The second function is called **named function expression**

You should always use **named function expression** and there are three reasons for that:

1.  Handy function self-reference (e.g. recursion)
2.  More debuggable stack traces
3.  More self-documenting code
